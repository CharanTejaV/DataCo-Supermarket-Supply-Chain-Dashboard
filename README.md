## Features and Measures
The dashboard leverages DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to compute complex measures and calculated columns that drive the analytics. Key measures include:
```
Fraud percentage =
VAR A = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('Order Dataset'[Order Id]), FILTER('Order Dataset', 'Order Dataset'[Order Status] = "SUSPECTED_FRAUD"))
VAR B = DISTINCTCOUNT('Order Dataset'[Order Id])
RETURN DIVIDE(A, B, 0)

Orders percentage = 
VAR S = SUM('Order Dataset'[Order Id])
VAR DIV = SUMX(ALL('Order Dataset'),'Order Dataset'[Order Id])
VAR SUMMARY = DIVIDE(S,DIV)*100
RETURN SUMMARY
```
